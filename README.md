5. Constraints

    Many users may not have regular internet access.

    NECTA copyright sensitivity (need to rewrite questions).

    Rewards system must be sustainable (consider ad partnerships or donor funds).

    Schools will promote the platform if it supports their pass rates.

    Students have at least occasional access to smartphones.
